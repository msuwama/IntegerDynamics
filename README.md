# IntegerDynamics
Code used to gather data for the paper Integer Dynamics. The paper is written with Dino Lorenzini, Mentzelos Melistas, Arvind Suresh and Haiyang Wang. The paper is about cycles generated by iteratively applying sum of the squares of the digits functions. We gathered data about the number of distinct cycles arising in different bases.
